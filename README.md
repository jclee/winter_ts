Winter
==

This project ports "Winter" -- an action role-playing game -- to run in a web browser.

- Demo: https://jclee.github.io/winter_ts/

Winter is a action role-playing game written using the ika game system, which
is authored in C++ and scripted in Python and runs on Windows.  For the port,
this has all been rewritten in Typescript.

This port is a work-in-progress.  Still to do:

* Determine if the game can even be completed in its current state
* Framerate is sometimes inconsistent
* Sound
* Music
* Misc refactoring
* Document porting process
